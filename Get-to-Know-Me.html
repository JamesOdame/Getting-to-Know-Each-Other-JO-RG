<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
<p>My name is James Odame, Currently, a 3 + 1 student enrolled in my last semester here at lewis. I was a student at the College of DuPage for the beginning half of the 3 + 1 Program. Recently got my Associates's degree from there.</p> 
<p>A bit about me personally I am the oldest of three I have my little sister Rachel who is 19 and currently going to Kennesaw State University in Georgia, she is the definition of a mini-me in personality. 
Then I also have my little brother Aiden who just turned 16 this past December, whereas my sister and I have a similar personality I and my brother look like twins. Love them both 
extremely proud of them as well.</p> 
<p>Moving on to my mother who is a social worker in a school district, she is an incredible inspiration to me and my siblings. My father who is Currently 
Ghana is working hard to build a business and a house out there for us to stay at when we visit there. </p>
<h2><u>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</u></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Throughout this course, I hope to gain experience in feeling what it's truly like to work in a developing team setting.</li>
  <li>At the end of this class I know we are supposed to do a bit of marketing of the product we create so I'm looking forward to seeing if that's something I'm interested in. </li>
  <li>Throughout the class, we are also required to use several different applications, learning them is something I am looking forward to learning as well for real-world applications.</li>
</ul>
<h2><u>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</u></h2>
<p>My hobbies have changed a bit with the whole covid pandemic happening. Previously before covid, my hobbies include going to Car shows and meets, going out and hanging with friends 
    and family, and participating in different projects. Now, after covid, my hobbies are mainly revolving around gaming and visiting my cousin when him and his family are available.</p>
<h2><u>Fun Fact</u></h2>
<p>A fun fact about me is that my first car was a 6 speed 2008 Altima coupe and I blew the motor 2 or 3 times. Wasn't a fun experience dealing with it at the time but its something I laugh at now </p>
